Used libraries:

- Pandas provides high-performance data structures and data analysis tools [8].

- re allows to specify rules and patterns for matching strings of regular expressions [9].

- nltk is used to work with human language data. The library provides an interface for lexical resources for text classification, tagging and parsing [10].

- scikit-Learn is built on top of other libraries, like NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib and provides supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms [11].

- spaCy is an open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) and analysing. In our work, spaCy is used to read text, extract sentences, tokenization and measuring the frequency of tokens [12].

- Plotly is used to create interactive graphs [13].
